It looks like your code is incomplete. I see that you have module.exports = ApplicationWindow as your last line so
I'm assuming you used the Master/Details Template for your file. Even using the template you have to place your 'app.js' into
a file called MasterView in order for all the sizing and orientation code for phones, tablets, the web, to apply to your code and
type in this line of code at the very end for it to work [module.exports = MasterView;]. Once that is done then I will be able to run
it on a phone and on a tablet or whatever device appropriate.
If you place it in an ApplicationWindow that would mean that the code would run on certain sizing conditions on your device/emulator.
Other than that your code seems to be good, you've include text, but I just don't understand why you have two biographies for your 
assignment. Am I missing snother file because all I saw was the one displayed from the link Lori gave me.
